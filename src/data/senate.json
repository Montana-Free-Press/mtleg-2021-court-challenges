Each Senate district spans two House districts."},{"type":"text","value":"Senators propose laws by introducing Senate bills, which face initial review in committees that decide which measures deserve debate on the Senate floor. Floor action occurs in two phases, usually on different days: a “second reading” where lawmakers debate a bill, consider amendments and vote on whether to advance the bill, and then a final “third reading” vote."},{"type":"text","value":"Senate bills that have passed the Senate are transmitted to the House, which conducts a similar review process. If a Senate bill is amended by the House, it is returned to the Senate for senators to vote again on the amended version. Once a bill passes both chambers, it is forwarded to the governor."},{"type":"text","value":"Bills fail either when lawmakers don’t advance them fast enough to meet procedural deadlines, or when they’re subjected to an adverse vote. In some cases, sponsors may also withdraw their bills from consideration."},{"type":"text","value":"Senators can also introduce resolutions, which are used for proposing legislative studies and miscellaneous tasks like adopting procedural rules. Senate resolutions are passed by the Senate alone and joint resolutions must be passed by both the Senate and House. Lawmakers can also propose voter referendums, or ballot measures for future elections. Referendum proposals must be passed by both the Senate and House, but don’t face review by the governor."}]}}
